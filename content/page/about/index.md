# About me

Hi! I'm Kristóf Torma and I am a Hungarian DevOps guy. I spend most if my time playing around with my homelab. There is still much to learn for me despite having tried many different ways to host services for myself and my close circle of friends and family. I try to keep things simple and on a reasonable budget, but I would rather do something right than cheap.

I lead a local group of students enthusiastic about computer science From 2020 until 2022. We are [KSZK](https://kszk.bme.hu/), or in English SIG for Computer Science. As a member I had the opportunity to operate services for real users and maintain the network of the Schönherz Dorm.

I use this blog to share my recent misadventures and lessons learned on a semi-frequent basis. Watch this space to learn with me!
